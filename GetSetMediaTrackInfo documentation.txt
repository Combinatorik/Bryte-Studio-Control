/*
All interaction with the server is done via 

wwr_req("command;command;command") 
or 
wwr_req_recur("command;command",interval):


(which are internally sent as /_/command;command;command;command to the server)

There can be any reasonable number of commands, separated by semicolons. They will be executed in order, and responses 
may be given, depending on the commands and the server.

The format of the response is a list of lines (separated by \n), and each line
has tokens separated by \t. 

Valid commands:

* numeric values 0-65535 
REAPER command IDs. (todo: support for registered names, too). These typically do not have any response.

* _123456789abcdef... 
REAPER plug-in registered command IDs (also used by ReaScripts and custom actions)

* TRANSPORT
Returns a line including (note that the spaces are here for readability, there
is actually only tabs between fields):
  TRANSPORT \t playstate \t position_seconds \t isRepeatOn \t position_string \t position_string_beats

playstate is 0 for stopped, 1 for playing, 2 for paused, 5 for recording, and 6 for record paused.

isRepeatOn will be nonzero if repeat is enabled.

position_string is always in the project timeline format (time, beats, etc), position_string_beats is always in measures.beats.hundredths format.

* BEATPOS
*
Returns a line:

BEATPOS \t playstate \t position_seconds \t full_beat_position \t measure_cnt \t beats_in_measure \t ts_numerator \t ts_denominator

* NTRACK

Requests track count. Returns a line:

  NTRACK \t value

value is 0 (no tracks, just master track) or greater. 

* TRACK  or   TRACK/index   or TRACK/start-end

Requests information about all tracks, a single track, or a range of tracks.
Note that the indices used are 0 for master, 1 for first user track, etc.

Returns any number of track lines:

  TRACK \t tracknumber \t trackname \t trackflags \t volume \t pan \t last_meter_peak \t last_meter_pos \t width/pan2 \t panmode \t sendcnt \t recvcnt \t hwoutcnt \t color
  
    tracknumber is 0 for master, 1 for first track, etc.
    trackname is the name of the track, or MASTER
    trackflags includes various bits (test with parseInt(field)&1 etc):
      1: folder
      2: selected
      4: has FX
      8: muted
      16: soloed (32: solo-in-place)
      64: record armed
      128: record monitoring on
      256: record monitoring auto
    volume is track volume, where 0 is -inf, 1 is +0dB, etc. see mkvolstr for dB conversions
    pan is -1..1, where -1 is full left, 0 is centered, 1 is full right
    last_meter_peak and last_meter_pos are integers that are dB*10, so -100 would be -10dB.
    color is in the form of 0xaarrggbb, nonzero if a custom color set
  
* GET/TRACK/x/SEND/y

Gets state for track x hardware output/send y. Returns a line:

SEND \t x \t y \t flags \t volume \t pan \t other_track_index

Use y=-1 for first receive, -2 for second, etc.

other_track_index is -1 if hardware output

flags & 8 is true if send/output muted

* GET/TRACK/index/xxxxxx

Requests information for track "index", via GetSetMediaTrackInfo(). See the REAPER API documentation for which
strings are acceptable, but for example you can query the track record input index for the first track via:

  GET/TRACK/1/I_RECINPUT

The returned string will be:

GET/TRACK/1/I_RECINPUT\t <index>

(if an error occurs you may get nothing back at all, or you might get the GET string back but with no parameter)

String will have newlines/tabs/backslashes encoded as \\n, \\t and \\. 

* SET/TRACK/index/xxxxx/value

Similar to GET/TRACK/index/xxxxx, but sets the value of this item. You probably will want to follow this with a SET/UNDO command, below. This will not give any response.

* SET/TRACK/index/VOL/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets volume for a track via control surface API (meaning it respects automation modes etc). If value starts with + or -, then adjustment is relative (in dB), otherwise adjustment is absolute (1=0dB, etc). If value ends in "g", then ganging is ignored. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/PAN/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets pan for a track via control surface API. If value starts with + or -, adjustment is relative. Range is always -1..1. If value ends in "g", then ganging is ignored. Does not need SET/UNDO.
*
* SET/TRACK/index/WIDTH/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets width for a track via control surface API. If value starts with + or -, adjustment is relative. Range is always -1..1. If value ends in "g", then ganging is ignored. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/MUTE/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets mute for track. if value is <0, mute is toggled. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/SOLO/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets solo for track. if value is <0, solo is toggled. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/FX/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets fx enabled for track. if value is <0, fx enabled is toggled. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/RECARM/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets record arm enabled for track. if value is <0, record arm enabled is toggled. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/RECMON/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets record monitoring for track. if value is <0, record monitoring is cycled, otherwise 1=on, 2=auto. Does not need SET/UNDO.

* SET/TRACK/index/SEL/value

Special case of SET/TRACK/index/xxxx, sets selection for track. if value is <0, selection is toggled. Does not need SET/UNDO.


* SET/UNDO/message

Adds an undo point, useful if you have modified anything that needs it.

* SET/UNDO_BEGIN

Begins an undo block (should always be matched with SET/UNDO_END!)

* SET/UNDO_END/message

Ends an undo block

* SET/REPEAT/val

If val is -1, toggles repeat, 0 disables repeat, 1 enables repeat.

* GET/REPEAT

Returns: 

GET/REPEAT \t val  

where val is 0 or 1.

* SET/TRACK/x/SEND/y/MUTE/value

Sets hardware output/send mute for track x, send y. value can be -1 to toggle.

Use y=-1 for first receive, -2 for second, etc.

* SET/TRACK/x/SEND/y/VOL/value

Sets hardware output/send volume (1.0 = +0dB) for track x, send y. append e to value to treat as "end" (capture), or "E" to treat as an instant edit.

Use y=-1 for first receive, -2 for second, etc.

* SET/TRACK/x/SEND/y/PAN/value

Sets hardware output/send pan (0=center, -1=left) for track x, send y. append e to value to treat as "end" (capture), or "E" to treat as an instant edit.

Use y=-1 for first receive, -2 for second, etc.

* SET/POS/value_in_seconds

Sets edit cursor position (seeking playback) to value_in_seconds

* SET/POS_STR/value_string

Sets edit cursor position (seeking playback) to value_string (format auto-detected)

r1 goes to region ID 1, m1 to marker 1, R1 to first timeline region, M1 to first timeline marker
